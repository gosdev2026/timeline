        <h2>Full-Stack Bootcamp Begins</h2>
        <p>
          I start studying a full-stack web development bootcamp by Angela Yu on
          Udemy from Argentina. My goal is to build a solid foundation in web
          development, starting with HTML and Git, and progressing step by step
          with consistency. This journey is focused on long-term growth,
          developing real skills, and creating new opportunities through
          discipline and daily practice. I am committed to becoming a
          professional web developer and building a future based on knowledge,
          not shortcuts.
